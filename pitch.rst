In this talk, I attempt to convey a basic understanding of the following:
* What Functional Programming is.
* What is provided within the Python Standard Library to make it be a Functional Programming Language.
* How that facility can be used in a practical manner.
* What the benefits of Functional Programming are.
* And how those benefits can be realized in Python.

I also get a bit meta with some mentions of Coconut (a Functional Programming Language that builds upon Python's Syntax, and compiles to vanilla Python.
